iOS App Documentation

Introduction

This document provides an overview of an iOS application developed using Expo, with Stripe for payment processing and Convex as the backend. The app integrates a Mapbox map to display nearby supermarkets and allows users to rate wine, cheese, and olive oil. It fetches real-time product data through APIs and offers a user experience similar to Wolt, customized for the Greek market. A key feature is the ability to select a product first, followed by dynamic filtering options.
